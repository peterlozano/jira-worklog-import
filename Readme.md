# CSV to Jira

This script allows to import a CSV file containing worklogs into Jira.

Install:

```
git clone https://github.com/peterlozano/jira-worklog-import.git
cd jira-worklog-import
composer install
```

Create a .env file with the following:

```
JIRA_HOST="https://<SUBDOMAIN>.atlassian.net"
JIRA_USER=""
JIRA_PASS=""
```

Usage:

* Make sure the csv file contains the following fields:
  * Date
  * Jira issue key
  * Description of the worklog
  * Time spent (in `HH:MM:SS` format)
  
* Adjust column numbers manually in script.

* Do a test run, make sure TESTING = true in the script.
```
php jira-worklog-import.php
```

* Look at output to see if columns were parsed correctly.
* Switch TESTING to false and do the final run.
